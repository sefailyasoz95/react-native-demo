This is a React Native project to showcase how I work with React Native.
TypeScript, React Navigation, Redux Toolkit, Lottie and many other libraries used in this project.

# Getting Started

> **Note**: Make sure you have completed the [React Native - Environment Setup](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) instructions till "Creating a new application" step, before proceeding.

## Step 1: Install node modules

First, you will need to install node modules via running:

```bash
# using npm
npm install

# OR using Yarn
yarn install
```

After installation, if you will run it on ios, you need to run

```bash
cd ios && pod install && cd ..
```

## Step 2: Start your Application

### For Android

```bash
# using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```

### For iOS

```bash
# using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
```

If everything is set up _correctly_, you should see your new app running in your _Android Emulator_ or _iOS Simulator_ shortly provided you have set up your emulator/simulator correctly.

If you face any difficulties or something throws some weird error, please contact with the developer.
